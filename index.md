## Interests of Works and Researches

### At NCSOFT 
From February 2019, I served for four years as the head of an organization known as the Data Center at NCSOFT. Contrary to what the name might suggest, the "Data Center" at NCSOFT is not an entity that operates hardware infrastructure. Rather, it is a designation for an organization where data engineers, analysts, and modelers collaborate together.

In my role as the head of the organization, I led the development of an independent data platform and foundational services for analysis based on open-source technology. I also developed analysis and dashboard services in close collaboration with the business analysis and modeling organization, as well as services for detecting fraudulent users. Although I do not have direct experience in engineering or development, my primary responsibility was facilitating the alignment and collaboration between engineers, analysts, data organizations, and other departments within the company, ensuring mutual understanding and cooperative efforts.

Before leading Data Center, my responsibilities encompassed the design of the(online) game economy, data analysis of online game log data, and the formulation of corporate strategies based on economic situation analysis.

### At KISDI

While at KISDI, my primary focus was on competition policy for the telecommunications industry. I extensively explored topics such as the tariff policy of mobile communications and the antitrust issues related to Korean online search engines.

### Graduate work 

In my doctoral thesis, I applied the methodologies of evolutionary game theory and its dynamics to various economic theories. The thesis is composed of three papers, each with a distinct theme. Their titles are:

  - "The Role of Opportunistic Punishment in the Evolution of Cooperation"
  - "Evolutionary Dynamics of Social Ties"
  - "Replicator Dynamics in Populations with Players of Diverse Abilities"

### Other topics 

Another facet of my research is centered on online games and their economic repercussions on society. The majority of my work is grounded in the particular context of the Korean online gaming industry, encompassing the effects of Real-Money Trading(RMT) on online gaming services and individual gamers. My research currently underway includes:

  a. Exploring the Relationship between Game Design, Player Behaviors, and RMT
  b. Analyzing User Data in Korean Online/Mobile Gaming
